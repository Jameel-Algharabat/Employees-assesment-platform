# Overview
I am excited to present my third project at Orange Coding Academy, an "Employee Evaluation Website" developed using JavaScript. The website is fully responsive and utilizes HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to evaluate employees based on technical, professional, and personal criteria. The website also includes a results section and a recommendation section for managers to provide guidance on enhancing employee performance. This project showcases my proficiency in JavaScript and my ability to apply it in a practical setting.
